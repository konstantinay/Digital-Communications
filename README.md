# Digital-Communications
University Project for core course Digital Communications

MATLAB codes for implementing:
* PCM Coding with Non-Uniform Quantization (Lloyd Max)
* Adaptive Delta Modulation

Testing them on 2 sources a) an AR(1) procedure and b) an image and measuring entropy and SQNR

* Performance Study of a Homogeneous Bandpass System M-PAM

Comparison of 4-PAM and 8-PAM by measuring BER and SER
